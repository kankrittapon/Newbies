requests==2.32.3
# Playwright >= 1.48 supports Python 3.13 (pins greenlet >= 3.1.x)
playwright>=1.48.0

# Notes for export/build:
# - Nuitka is a build tool (not needed at runtime). Use requirements-build.txt
# - After installing Playwright, run: `playwright install chromium` (or the browsers you need)
# - If you must stay on Playwright 1.45.x, use Python 3.12 instead of 3.13 to avoid greenlet build errors.
